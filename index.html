                <p>
                    A black hole may look scary, but how would you even know?
                    Their gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even
                    light, can escape. So maybe you won't really be seeing a
                    black hole on our tour, but the event horizon is just as
                    cool!

                <p>
                    A white hole is the black hole's antisocial cousin. It spits
                    out matter and light, but never lets any in. Problem is, we
                    really don't know if they exist. Please don't ask for a
                    refund!

                        I focused on mostly decoration for this website; it
                        ended up becoming one of the more visually appealing
                        projects I've made. Hopefully I'll have the chance to
                        code more projects in the future!

                    This part of the tour is sponsored by an imploded star; we
                    wouldn't being enjoying this tour without it!
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Before that star imploded, nuclear fusion fought against
                    gravity and kept the star stable. However, the star was
                    <strong>large.</strong>
                </p>
                <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                <p>
                    Massive stars generate iron, which is a problem because that
                    reaction doesn't produce energy. The star's core fills up
                    with iron until the balance with the external gravity is
                    broken. The core collapses, and creates a supernova. It
                    could've become a neutron star, but the star was too big.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The core collapses into a singularity, and the star becomes
                    a black hole.
                </h3>
                <hr class="divider" />
                <h3>
                    Black holes don't suck you in, so why can't you escape them?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    What we're observing now is the event horizon; essentially
                    <strong>"the point of no return."</strong> If our "tour bus"
                    were to cross... well, all directions we could go lead to
                    the singularity. This is because the black hole's gravity is
                    so strong that it warps spacetime.
                </p>
                <h3>Well, what's a singularity?</h3>
                <p>
                    We don't exactly know... some scientists think that the
                    singularity is infinitely dense, with almost no volume. We
                    <i>thankfully</i> will not be making the discovery
                    ourselves.
                </p>
                <hr class="divider" />

                <h3>This black hole may disappear sometime soon!</h3>
                <p>
                    Thankfully, sometime soon is in about 10^100 years, don't
                    stress about not getting your money's worth. The dissipation
                    process of a black hole is called Hawking Radiation, and it
                    takes a <strong>long</strong> time.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Essentially, space has particles popping into, and
                    “annihilating” each other from existence.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When this happens near the event horizon, one particle gets
                    sucked in, and the other escapes. The escaping particle
                    steals energy from the black hole, and the black hole loses
                    mass. This process is incredibly slow, but it's happening
                    right now.
