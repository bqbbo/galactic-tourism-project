                    A black hole may look scary, but how would you even know?
                    Their gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even
                    light, can escape. So maybe you won't really be seeing a
                    black hole on our tour, but the event horizon is just as
                    cool!

                    A white hole is the black hole's antisocial cousin. It spits
                    out matter and light, but never lets any in. Problem is, we
                    really don't know if they exist. Please don't ask for a

                        The information is organized in somewhat of a story; I'd
                        recommend going in the presented order.

                    <p id="info-description">
                        I focused on mostly decoration for this website; it
                        ended up becoming one of the more visually appealing
                        projects I've made. Hopefully I'll have the chance to
                        code more projects in the future!

                        Programming takes a while; I spent almost seven hours
                        working on styling alone. However, the final result came
                        out very well in my opinion, and was worth the time.

                    This part of the tour is sponsored by an imploded star; we
                    wouldn't being enjoying this tour without it!
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Before that star imploded, nuclear fusion fought against
                    gravity and kept the star stable. However, the star was
                    <strong>large.</strong>
                </p>
                <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                <p>
                    Massive stars generate iron, which is a problem because that
                    reaction doesn't produce energy. The star's core fills up
                    with iron until the balance with the external gravity is
                    broken. The core collapses, and creates a supernova. It
                    could've become a neutron star, but the star was too big.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The core collapses into a singularity, and the star becomes
                    a black hole.
                </h3>
                <hr class="divider" />
                <h3>
                    Black holes don't suck you in, so why can't you escape them?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    What we're observing now is the event horizon; essentially
                    <strong>"the point of no return."</strong> If our "tour bus"
                    were to cross... well, all directions we could go lead to
                    the singularity. This is because the black hole's gravity is
                    so strong that it warps spacetime.
                </p>
                <h3>Well, what's a singularity?</h3>
                <p>
                    We don't exactly know... some scientists think that the
                    singularity is infinitely dense, with almost no volume. We
                    <i>thankfully</i> will not be making the discovery
                    ourselves.
                </p>

                <h3>This black hole may disappear sometime soon!</h3>
                <p>
                    Thankfully, sometime soon is about
                    <strong>10<sup>100</sup></strong> years, don't stress about
                    not getting your money's worth. The dissipation process of a
                    black hole is called Hawking Radiation, and it takes a
                    <strong>long</strong> time.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Essentially, space has particles popping into, and
                    “annihilating” each other from existence.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When this happens near the event horizon, one particle gets
                    sucked in, and the other escapes. The escaping particle
                    steals energy from the black hole, and the black hole loses
                    mass. This process is incredibly slow, but it's happening
                    right now.

                <h3>Woah, did that black hole just spit out a planet?</h3>
                <p>
                    Haha, just kidding. We'd have to get pretty luck to see a
                    white hole; scientists aren't even 100% sure they exist.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    White holes are the mathematical opposite of black holes.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    They're the result of a solution to the Einstein Field
                    Equations, but they're not very stable. They're like a black
                    hole, but they spit out matter and light, and don't let
                    anything in.
                </p>
                <h3>How would a white hole push you away?</h3>
                <p>
                    White holes have a repulsive force, which is the opposite of
                    gravity. If you were to get close to a white hole, you'd be
                    pushed away at an increasing speed. Essentially "negative
                    gravity," which is a concept we aren't too familiar with.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Scientists think that white holes are the time reverse of
                    black holes.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    They think white holes' singularities exist in the past, and
                    black holes' singularities exist in the future. However, the
                    existence of white holes violates multiple assumptions; "How
                    can a white hole exist if it's spitting out matter?" "Isn't
                    entropy supposed to increase?"

                    <br /><br />

                    Another thing to add; matter spat out of a white hole may
                    collide with the matter around the event horizon, which
                    would cause the white hole to collapse into a black hole.
                </p>
                <hr class="divider" />
                <h3>Any promising theories?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you're good at reading math equations, maybe. Some
                    scientists think the death of a black hole could result in a
                    white hole. As the black hole loses mass, it would further
                    defy physics and gravity, but would still contain all the
                    matter it consumed (cause quantum physics says so!!) and if
                    multiple factors align, a black hole could potentially start
                    spitting out matter.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    If this theory holds, white holes could recreate conditions
                    for life!
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Instead of the universe becoming nothing, and our touring
                    business going bankrupt, white holes could potentially
                    refill the universe with matter and energy. Its a genius
                    business strategy!
