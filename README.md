# Galactic Tourism Project - A static website/presentation for a space-related science project.

Written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Can be accessed [here](https://bqbbo.github.io/galactic-tourism-project/).

## Background

The project required me to research four celestial object, and choose three to compile into the final project.

I chose the following,

- Black Holes
- White Holes
- Wormholes

The fourth would've been Neutron Star, but I had trouble finding information on those; it was also a theme choice to select all "holes."

## Website

This ended up being one of the nicest static websites I've ever made. I used GitHub Copilot to create a basic CSS framework and then gradually changed it to the way I liked. It was also the project with the most lines of HTML and CSS.

This took me about a week to make, or ~10 hours in total. I grinded most of the raw content on 9/22/24 and spent most of the time prior decorating with CSS.

**If this wasn't already obvious, this project will not be maintained by me following the date of submission, however, I'm open to noting this likely doesn't work on smaller viewports and would greatly appreciate any contributions.**
